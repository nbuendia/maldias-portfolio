## Introduction

### THIS PROJECT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

Welcome to my portfolio! Here I showcase my favorite projects. I was inspired to make this feel as close to a computer terminal as I can manage. I had an idea and ran with it!

Use commands to see different parts of the page, answer prompts and maybe even find some easter eggs üòÅ

Give it a try! Tell me what you think!

Check out the "Getting started" section to run this project locally

## Description

Upon entering you'll see a small intro animation and then the terminal style page will render. Use the input at the bottom of the page to trigger different views on the terminal section of the page.

### A few commands you might find handy
to navigate to different parts of the page, use:
- run about
- run contact
- run projects

## Where to view
